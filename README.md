## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the first website I will build with a height more than 100vh (Standard viewport height).
I really worked hard to make sure that the content rendered in screen views were relevant and the components on the page were displayed in a reasonable position relative to the screen.


### Continued development

I will continue to sharpen my HTML and CSS skils before touching a line of JavaScript. This is the pah I believe will make me most efficient in mastering front-end development.
By the way, time to take on more challenges on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
